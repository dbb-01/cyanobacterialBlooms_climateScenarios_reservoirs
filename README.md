Eutrophication has become a global environmental and ecological problem affecting the aquatic ecosystem and drinking water supply. This process is often manifested by an increase in Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (Cyano-HABs), which have increased considerably in recent years due to climate change and increased anthropogenic pressure. To address these problems, predictive models have been developed by identifying and quantifying the main factors affecting these phenomena using the Partial Least Square Path Modelling (PLS-PM) methodology. These models have been developed for two different reservoirs (Galicia, NW Spain) that have suffered numerous episodes of Cyano-HABs in recent years. The influence of climatic conditions, water physicochemical parameters, trophic state, reservoir flow and nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) on the concentration of cyanobacteria has been analysed. Specifically, different scenarios have been analysed to evaluate how the application of measures and the different climate scenarios evaluated for the years 2050 and 2075 (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) influence the concentration of cyanobacteria. The results indicate that model 2 developed for the A Baxe reservoir stands out as the most relevant where 68% of the "Cyanobacteria Concentration” is predicted by the studied variables highlighting the substantial influence of "Temperature" (W=0.609) and "Phosphorus" (W=0.981). Regarding the scenarios developed, it has been observed that the application of measures combined with environmental monitoring techniques are fundamental tools for mitigating the effects derived from eutrophication by reducing the cyanobacteria concentration by 2.2% in a favourable scenario. The effective application of these models would represent a significant advance in reservoir management and decision-making, improving environmental governance and favouring water security management.
